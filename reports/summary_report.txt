Date Generated: 2026-02-18 08:52:03

KEY METRICS:
- Overall Average Delay: 16.14 min
- 95th Percentile Delay: 43.00 min
- Worst Performing Route: 33A (Gandhipuram - Mettupalayam) (Avg 24.39 min)
- Most Congested Hour:    9:00 (Avg 19.39 min)
- Top Inefficient Route:  2A (Perur - Polytechnic) (Score 0.34)

----------------------------------------
AUTOMATED RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Route 2A (Perur - Polytechnic): High Inefficiency (> 0.25) -> Increase frequency during peak hours & review schedule
2. Route 32 (Gandhipuram - Thudiyalur): High Inefficiency (> 0.25) -> Increase frequency during peak hours & review schedule
3. Route 111 (Thudiyalur - Gandhipuram): High Inefficiency (> 0.25) -> Increase frequency during peak hours & review schedule
4. Route 4A (Thudiyalur - Podanur): High Inefficiency (> 0.25) -> Increase frequency during peak hours & review schedule
5. Route 70 (Gandhipuram - Maruthamalai): High Inefficiency (> 0.25) -> Increase frequency during peak hours & review schedule
6. Route 33A (Gandhipuram - Mettupalayam): High Inefficiency (> 0.25) -> Increase frequency during peak hours & review schedule
7. Route ALL: Significant Peak Congestion (+669%) -> Reschedule departure times to buffer peak delays
8. Route 2A (Perur - Polytechnic): High Delay Variability (Std Dev > 10m) -> Investigate inconsistent traffic patterns or driver performance
9. Route 33A (Gandhipuram - Mettupalayam): High Delay Variability (Std Dev > 10m) -> Investigate inconsistent traffic patterns or driver performance
10. Route 4A (Thudiyalur - Podanur): High Delay Variability (Std Dev > 10m) -> Investigate inconsistent traffic patterns or driver performance
11. Route 70 (Gandhipuram - Maruthamalai): High Delay Variability (Std Dev > 10m) -> Investigate inconsistent traffic patterns or driver performance
